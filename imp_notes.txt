take care about which license this app should have 
every time you are just showing verified product reviews tell this to the users (also this is true about comments of blog posts)
seperate auth needed routes from others and auth user by either its admin profile or with super admin access token 
use --no-dotfiles when using http-server becuse super admin token and ... are stored in .env

when using start script in this commit 
on production server when reloading the page 
sometimes it says websocket isnt connected or something like that
i didnt see that happening when using dev script 


take care of these before each production build which is going to be used by end users:
that problem of not rerendering comp when route chagnes from /foo/22 to /foo/33
