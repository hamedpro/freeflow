collaboration system : 
    concept
        every note or task or resource or pack has a 
        number of users as its "collaborators" and we
        call all other users "others". 
        
        only one of collaborators is "owner".

        each pack or note or task or resource has a "rules"
        value which clarify exact privileges of
        each user whether that user is owner or another
        collaborator or considered as "others".

        this value ('rules') also saves other fields like the percentage of
        approval required to accept an incoming change suggesstion and fields like this.

    implementation
        each task or resource or note or pack is saved as a js object (called document) in mongodb 
        this object has a collaborators field with type of "array" which includes objects in this shape : 
        {user_id : <24 digit hex mongodb _id> , is_owner : boolean  }

        also it has another field "rules":
