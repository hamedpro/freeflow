<h1>🤔 what FreeFlow exactly is ?</h1>
in any app store you search, there is a dedicated category for <mark>⚡️"Productivity Applications"</mark> with a plenty of choices for each tool each trying to please a taste. with all of them in mind, we are not going to "reinvent the wheel". <mark>we think its the time to take the wheel to its next generation...! </mark>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;padding-top:20px;flex-direction:column;">

<h1>🤔 what does next gen mean ?!</h1>


<b>🕰️ 🧙‍♂️ Time Machine</b>
<br /> 
always keep track of changes. <b>no overwrite at all ! </b>. <mark>it means we exactly now what is happening now and has happened before all over the network.</mark> it enables a set of features such as the awesome <b>"Time Machine"</b> ! you can go back in time  to match any previous state of anything you want. also you can see raw and <mark>human readable interpreted timelines</mark> of changes. you dont want to be worried about mistakenly deletions at all any more.
<br />
<br />
<b>🔓 🗝️ Free. Open source. Community driven but supported.</b>
<br />
code is 100 transparent && licensed completely under free licenses : most MIT. some benefits :
- <b>👮 🪪 security: </b> you can exactly know what is being run on your device. zero percent of doubt will be remaind it terms privacy and security stuff. 
- <b>👩‍💻🧑‍💻 community power: </b> no need to say! with the code being available publicly, <mark>anyone can review, test or devlop it.</mark> issues can be reported and solved by any developer who has passion to contribute to open source community. anyone will work on what he/she is the best at. features can easily add to please any taste. translation packs and themes and ... can be developed <mark>all free, super quick and open !</mark>
- <b>public ownership of frequently used tools :</b> unless something like our project exist, ownership of tools that most of us use everyday will belong to big companies 🤑 . we need to pay 💸 and worse than that we have to accept only what they are offeing 😠😂 and their terms.
<br /> 
    > Jadi Mirmirani always says these kinds of freedom will shape a better world 🌎 ... 

    so lets be positive to internatioal society 🙂💕 !

<b>🕰️⚡️ realtime sync:</b> by using power of websockets and React we keep the UI always reflecting the most edge changes of the network 🥳. when this is added to awesome compressings and caches solutions, always the data you wanna be updated with is sit locally inside your device 🧘‍♀️ . so any computation such as filters and sorts are done instantly ⚡️ . no more reloads. no more loadings. isnt it wonderful 🥰 ...?!
<br />
<br />
<b>🤩 👾 being extensible in every aspect.</b> 
remember i told you anyone can review and customize 100 % the source code for him/herself ? you can also do the customisation in runtime level 😬💪🙂 . i mean think of a server that is serving an instance of our platform; you can :
- <b>retrieve data from API.</b> you can subscribe to data changes or just get them all at once. then you can 
    - 💅 show it in a UI that you have built from scratch for example for any OS ( 📱 or 🖥️ ).
    - 🗂️ use it as a backup file
    - 📈 do computations and analyzations on existing data; for example charts can be drawn from long time calendar data.
    - 🛸 anything else ...
- <b>uploading any data structure :</b> you can upload <mark>whatever data you need</mark> to an existing server (we call them `remotes`). dont waste time maitaining your server. `authentication`, `memory caches`, `resolving json special refs`, `concurrency locks`, `xz compression`, `access levels system`, `websockets & realtime sync` and much more are already done for you at this very moment of writing ! an awesome feature it enables, <mark>is that for example you can encrypt your data using whatever encryption algo you want.</mark> will there be any chance of security issues 🤯🤟 ...?!
<br />
<br />

<b>🌎 Localization : </b> unlike similar applications which only support most used 📆 calendars and languages, in our platform any custom translation pack or calendar is welcomed 🙂 . now these languages and calendars below are finalized to be the starting point.
- 🌎 Persian lang 
- 🌎 English lang
- 📆 solar Hijri 
- 📆 Arabic Hijri
- 📆 Gregorian

<b>💄 💅 User Exprience (UX) :</b> 
- <b>⚙️ stability: </b> we want our platform to be as stable as it can be. 
    - 🧪 testing everything well, 
    - 🐾 tracking issues, 
    - 🐛 and taking bug reports seriously.
<br />
🤔 💭 think of an application which any of its parts has been 🧪 tested many times with any possible situations in mind... 🤓
<br />
<br />

- <b>🤑 ⚙️ stable but feature rich: </b> some platforms which want to keep their platform stable are `🐌 too slow` in adding new features because they say stabilisation takes time ⏰. i hope we are not going to be like them!😬 but if possible.
<br />
<br />
- <b>❤️‍🩹 💖 its all about feelings: </b> we are living to feel something `🐣 new`, `🫐 fresh` and `🥰 awesome`. its not enough to have a stable and feature rich application that only `👩‍🔬 experts` can take advantage of. we wanna every part of it to make user feel extremely well 🤤. well thought 👨‍🎨 designs and use of user friendly `animations` makes it  sweet and easy to use ! also your 💭 feedbacks will be the way that using that we find out what you like and what you dont.
<br />
<br />
- <b>😢 🔮 Error handling: </b> even if everything is 🧪 tested, there will be a chance of that something go wrong 🙍‍♀️. in that case, instead of showing annoying alerts like "Something went wrong", we design our application in a way that informs the user what has gone wrong and gives him a way to track the issue until its addressed 🐾.

<b>👩‍💻  🖥️ Developer Exprience (DX) : </b> we will constantly try to improve code's readability and how to use 📃 documentations. we really want to make it sweet for `developers` to work with code, as much as we wanted for end users.

<h1>🧸🦄 exact tools we offer now</h1>

- <b>📝 Notes :</b> just like any other note taking platform you can write down and share your 💭 thoughts by writing, drawing tables, having ✅ checkboxes and more.
- <b>🎪 Tasks and events : </b> tasks are what is planned to be done but events are what has actually happened. like any 📆 calendar and ⏰ time management platforms out there, you can save and track what is going on in your days. 📈 visualized data will help you to better understand the patterns. in addition to power of analytics you will also not miss any plans again 🤓.
- <b>🙋‍♀️ Asks :</b> 3 type of `🤔 questions` can be asked the audience. ✅ multiple choice test, text answer ones and 🗳️ polls. there are many useful use cases for this unit that will be explained later. track `real life use cases` section of here for more. 
- <b>🗂️ Resources :</b> you've most probably used ☁️ cloud storage services before → Resource unit is just like Google Drive but without its complexity and depth. simply upload any file to the cloud, and file will be accessible from 🌎 anywhere. share them with for example teammates and others and use them inside your documents and messages. you can also use 📃 PDFs, 🎧 audios, 🌁 images and 📽️ videos directly from the application without even downloading.
- <b>📂 packs :</b> just like the folders in any operating system of your choice where you have folders to keep files inside them, you can put all units inside a pack and it can also be inside another pack. `use any level of nesting to exactly organize units.`

<b>💬 we call these "units".</b> you can assign any number of 👩‍💼 users you want to a unit and have 📝 conversations under it just like the concept of comments of 👩‍💻GitHub issues.
<br />
<br />
<b>🔋 power of combination.</b> units can be used together. for example a 📽️` short video` is a very nice way to communicate with your teammates about something you both are working to solve. it can be uploaded as a 🗂️` Resource` and be referenced inside a message.` as easy as it seems!`
<br />
<h1>🤖 🤗 real life & awesome use cases</h1>
🔜 this part is planned to be done soon.

<br />
<br />
<h1>🧑‍💻 🖥️ setting dev environment</h1>

> this instruction is meant to be used in mac or common linux distros. almost sure will not work in windows. 

all you need is to clone the repo then install npm dependencies using: 

```
npm install ; 
``` 
application data is saved in 🗂️ `~/.freeflow_data` <br />
application data means all env vars and uploaded files and every tranasction that will be created in application. `it simply means everything.` application will not use anywhere else in the disk even its repository dir itself. <br />
so there are a few 🖥️ ⚙️ bash scripts in root of repo to help you get thing done ⚡️ quickly.

```
./init_data_dir.bash // creates a .freeflow_data and required all dirs and files. fills them with initial values. for env vars it creates env.json and fills it with a template and opens vi to customize it. after changes wq the vi and all is done.

./reset_but_env.bash // it resets everything inside data dir to their initial values but env.json
```

finally when you created data dir, you can use any of npm scripts : 

```
npm start ; //for production 
npm run dev ; //to start development mode 
```

<b>you're good to go !</b>

<h1>🙋‍♀️ how can i contribute ?</h1>
the best way is to help us improve the code. adding features and new grown ideas, testing and fixing bugs, refactoring and improving codes, etc...
<br />
<br />

`there are always a lot of different issues open.` take a look at them and you will find some of them exciting for yourself 🤓. there are tasks labeled either `UX` or `functionality`. `UX` ones are meant to <mark>just make something work</mark>. for example adding a feature in a certain way of implementation. `not` caring about if it looks good or can have better styles. on the other hand `ux` issues are not meant to modify behaviours that much. <mark>just try to think well in order to make an existing behaviour make people feel awesome!</mark>
<br />
<br />


also there is a label `"clear"` there. an issue is just an idea at the beginning, <mark>when its clear enough to be implemented its `clear`</mark>. in this step, the specifications must be clear.

<h1>💸 donation</h1>

for now we `dont` have a paypal or something to get donations.
maybe someday we open such accounts <mark>but for now help us through improving the code.</mark> (take a look `"at how can i contribute"` part )
<br />
<br />
<h1>👩‍💻 ⚙️ stable checks</h1>

there are a few error patterns we may forget during development.
list of them is always kept in `stablility_tests.txt`
<mark>check them before each stable release or merge to stable branch</mark>
